Seriously.    Google owns these images and if you want to use them you have to give attribution and match their Terms of Service (read them here: https://developers.google.com/maps/terms).  This is a personal / educational project.


### How to use
Like I said,  Don't use this to make big maps - it pretty much won't work.  But if you want to try just clone the repo and then command line something like 
`
php index.php 42.39506551565123 -71.16668701171875 42.32200108060305 -71.00326538085938 15 name
